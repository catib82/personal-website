      How to determine what is foundational in art education? In a moment where we are rethinking art history and all the canons it has perpetuated, it is a stimulating conversation to try to define what is foundational. In my Studio Art Foundations class at Smith College I have approached it with experimentation, and inclusiveness of aesthetics and practices, but with certain conceptual requirements. I prompt the students to think about what they are trying to communicate, what is the idea, and how are they going to create it through several assignments, including a 2D piece, a 3D piece, and a time based piece. And although freedom can become the biggest challenge that students have to overcome, the results are always surprising. Materials and their history take a relevant spot in my class. For instance, the 3D assignment requires the students to recycle or repurpose a material. It is contextualized with a lecture in which I show more than 20 artists –like Robert Rauschenberg, Rachel Whiteread, Alejandro Aravena, Orly Genger, or El Anatsui– that have used recycled materials in one way or another. This assignment helps the students to reconsider all the materials that surround us, and introduces the idea of material as a message. Critiques are a crucial part of all my syllabi, it is during critiques that students learn how to articulate their thoughts around the work of their classmates, and therefore around any artwork.<br>

      In 2021 I taught three photography courses at Columbia University, two remote sessions of the introductory class Photo I, and the advanced class Photo II in person. I faced the challenges of
      remote learning. Some of those were technical, like not being able to easily show how to change
      a setting on a camera, and also how to engage 20 students on a screen. As in every class I teach, I made efforts and created strategies for every single student to participate, and to feel engaged in
      their own work but also the work of their classmates, such as having them respond to a different
      question every day at the beginning of the class, or assign them artists that would be relevant to
      their practice to research and give a presentation about it in class. A lot of times it is a matter of
      listening to what the students are interested in, and being able to accommodate certain sessions
      to that theme. At the beginning of every class I teach, I do a survey to understand where
      students are at technically, but also to give them choices for at least one or two sessions, and
      leave room for changes and adjustments. For my Photo II class, I worked with a hybrid group of
      students - half of them had taken a digital Photo I course remotely, and the others had previously taken an analog photo class before COVID. I adjusted my syllabus to a combination of analog and digital, which would guarantee that all the students would increase their skills in photography during the semester.<br>

      For me teaching art means to be willing to learn, relearn, think and rethink. Students need to
learn skills, and also be capable of solving problems. That can mean math, technology, or a craft,
but it also means being able to explain to a skilled professional –for instance a woodshop
manager or a 3D printer– what they are trying to make in order to get the guidance they need. I
believe these resources can be used for them to thrive in their art classes, but also in their lives.
